          Architecture for a UK domestic real-time account-to-account (A2A) payment scheme that
          provides a card-like merchant and customer experience while settling instantly over
          Faster Payments and keeping control and economics within UK rails.

          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            UK domestic retail payments are dominated by global card networks, even though the UK
            operates a mature real-time account-to-account rail via Faster Payments (FPS). This
            creates higher domestic costs, longer settlement cycles and limited UK sovereignty over
            scheme rules and risk models.
          </p>
          <p>
            The objective was to design a domestic A2A merchant payment scheme that could act as a
            modern alternative to cards for UK transactions: real-time settlement, lower cost,
            strong customer protection and a familiar experience for both merchants and customers.
          </p>

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            The key challenges were:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Providing a <strong>card-like UX</strong> (tap, QR, online checkout) on top of FPS,
              which is natively “just a payment rail”.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensuring <strong>customer privacy</strong> by removing the need to expose bank
              account numbers to merchants.
            </li>
            <li>
              Designing a central scheme layer that could coordinate
              <strong>routing, fraud, SCA and disputes</strong> for many issuers, acquirers and
              merchants.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creating a <strong>clear liability and dispute model</strong> consistent with
              irrevocable FPS payments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Maintaining <strong>international acceptance</strong> via co-badged instruments
              alongside global card networks.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
          <p>
            I designed a scheme-layer architecture organised into several domains, each responsible
            for a different part of the end-to-end A2A merchant payment lifecycle:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Customer domain</strong> – banking apps and wallets used for Strong Customer
              Authentication (SCA), approvals and dispute views.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Merchant domain</strong> – POS, SoftPOS and e-commerce platforms integrating
              via a single Merchant Integration Gateway.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Scheme access layer</strong> – standardised integration APIs for merchants,
              acquirers and issuers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Scheme core</strong> – switching, orchestration, routing, tokenisation,
              fraud/risk and dispute management.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Issuer PSPs</strong> – customer ledgers, SCA and outbound FPS payments.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Acquirer PSPs</strong> – merchant settlement ledgers, merchant onboarding and
              inbound FPS processing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Settlement rail</strong> – Faster Payments, used for real-time movement of
              funds between issuers and acquirers.
            </li>
          </ul>

          />

          <h2>Key Architectural Components</h2>

          <h3>1. Access Layer</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Merchant Integration Gateway (MIG)</strong> – single northbound API for
              merchants and acquirers to initiate payments, query status, manage refunds and receive
              notifications. Abstracts underlying scheme complexity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Issuer Integration Gateway</strong> – southbound API for issuers to receive
              payment requests, trigger SCA and return authorisation outcomes. Supports different
              integration patterns and secure, encrypted channels.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. Scheme Core Services</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Scheme Switch / Orchestrator</strong> – coordinates the end-to-end flow from
              merchant initiation to final confirmation, managing transaction state, applying scheme
              rules and calling risk services.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tokenisation &amp; Alias Service</strong> – maps QR/NFC tokens, device
              tokens or merchant-presented aliases to underlying customer accounts, ensuring account
              numbers are never exposed to merchants.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Directory / Participant Registry</strong> – maintains routing data, issuer
              and acquirer capabilities, limits and status; the switch uses this to choose the
              correct issuer/acquirer path.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fraud &amp; Risk Engine</strong> – performs real-time fraud scoring using
              behavioural analytics, device attributes, merchant profiles and transaction history.
              Provides allow/decline/step-up-SCA decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dispute Management &amp; Liability Engine</strong> – manages claims and
              evidence, and assigns financial responsibility according to the scheme rulebook.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Refund Orchestration Engine</strong> – processes approved refunds as new FPS
              credit transfers back to the customer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data &amp; Reporting Platform</strong> – centralised data store supporting
              clearing, scheme-level reporting, analytics, risk models and regulatory reporting.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Security &amp; Platform Services</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>HSM-backed key management.</li>
            <li>Mutual TLS and strong authentication between all scheme components.</li>
            <li>Comprehensive audit logging and traceability across flows.</li>
            <li>Operational monitoring, alerting and SRE practices.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>End-to-End Payment Flow</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Merchant initiates payment:</strong> Merchant POS/SoftPOS/e-commerce
              integrates with the MIG to create a payment request.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Scheme runs risk &amp; routing:</strong> Scheme switch resolves customer
              token/alias, runs real-time fraud checks and selects the correct issuer/acquirer using
              the directory.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Issuer SCA:</strong> The scheme sends an authorisation request to the issuer.
              The issuer triggers SCA in the customer’s banking app or wallet; the customer reviews
              and approves the payment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>FPS settlement:</strong> Once approved, the issuer debits the customer and
              sends an FPS credit to the acquirer PSP.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Merchant credited:</strong> The acquirer credits the merchant settlement
              account and updates merchant balances.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Confirmation:</strong> Authorisation and settlement confirmations flow back
              through the scheme to the merchant, and the customer sees the transaction in their
              banking app in real time.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Disputes &amp; Refunds Model</h2>
          <p>
            Because FPS payments are irrevocable, the scheme cannot rely on traditional
            chargebacks. Instead, it uses a <strong>claims-and-refunds</strong> model:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Customer raises a claim with their issuer.</li>
            <li>Issuer submits the claim to the scheme dispute system.</li>
            <li>Merchant/acquirer provides supporting evidence.</li>
            <li>Liability Rules Engine determines which party is responsible.</li>
            <li>
              Refund Orchestration Engine instructs a new FPS credit from the liable party to the
              customer.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Optionally, a <strong>scheme guarantee pool</strong> can be introduced to handle
            specific categories of fraud (e.g. certain APP fraud scenarios), balancing customer
            protection with scheme economics.
          </p>

          <h2>International Payments via Co-Badging</h2>
          <p>
            For global acceptance, the architecture supports <strong>co-badged instruments</strong>
            where cards or wallet tokens carry:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A <strong>domestic A2A scheme identifier</strong> used by UK POS and merchants to
              route payments over the A2A scheme and FPS.
            </li>
            <li>
              An <strong>international card network identifier</strong> (e.g. Visa/Mastercard) used
              abroad or where A2A is not supported.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This follows patterns similar to Brazil (Elo + Discover), Malaysia (MyDebit +
            Visa/Mastercard) and France (Carte Bancaire + Visa), keeping domestic transactions on
            low-cost national rails while maintaining global reach.
          </p>

          <h2>Outcomes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A coherent target architecture for a UK domestic A2A merchant payment scheme that can
              match card UX while using FPS for real-time settlement.
            </li>
            <li>
              Strong customer privacy via tokenisation and issuer-based SCA.
            </li>
            <li>
              Clear dispute and liability model aligned with FPS finality.
            </li>
            <li>
              Architecture that balances domestic control, scheme economics and international
              acceptance through co-badging.
            </li>
